## Viewing the project locally
* You must have Nodejs and NPM installed on your computer.
* In the project directory run ```npm install``` to install the dependencies.
* Run ```npm run build``` to build the project files and start the server in development mode.
* To run the server in production mode set the environment variable ```NODE_ENV=production```
* One way to set the environment variable is to create file named ```.env``` in the root directory of the project and save the content ```NODE_ENV=production``` in that file (This way works as we are using [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) package from npm).
