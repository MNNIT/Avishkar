So we present to you the very dais to bring out yours.Unlimited ice cream sticks. Five creative minds. One structure. Strive for perfection in everything you do. Take the best that exists and make it better. When it does not exist, design it.—Sir Henry Royce, English engineer One of the biggest engineering problems is to connect people, to overcome physical obstructions and topographical boundaries for proper development of our society. Bridges provide the structural solution to all these problems, guaranteeing safest and easiest link between two parts through most adverse conditions like rivers, canopies, oceans, trenches and much more. Bridges are essential to our nation's infrastructural development Here at LINKIDGE event of Avishkar we provide you a platform to showcase your innovation, creativity, knowledge, and ability to tackle practical problems related to connecting to places with a model bridge."
