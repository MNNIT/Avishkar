				The problem statement carries the title, “Designing of Floating Point Multiplier with Low Power and High Speed VLSI Design techniques”. The event is aimed at the synthesis solutions of this problem statement with its behavioral simulation and implementation of the design on the FPGA kit. The problem statement carries various add-ons which will carry additional marks. The event will test the theoretical understanding of Verilog language, FPGA kits, and problem statement on the basis of different rounds of the event.
